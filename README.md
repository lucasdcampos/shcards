# SHCards (Shell Cards)

SHCards is a terminal-based flashcard application. The goal of SHCards is to provide a simple and efficient tool for creating and reviewing flashcards directly in the terminal.

> **Note**: This project is currently under development. There are no releases available yet.

---

## Features (Planned)
- **Create Flashcards**: Add and organize flashcards using a plain text or terminal-based input system.
- **Review Mode**: Study your flashcards using spaced repetition techniques.
- **Customizable Decks**: Organize your flashcards into separate decks for better management.
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor your learning progress directly in the terminal.

## Usage
Currently, SHCards is not ready for use, but here is a preview:

```
> deck create programming
Deck 'programming' succesfully created
```
```
> deck addcard programming
Front: What are Functions?
Back: Functions are a reusable block of code that performs a specific task or calculation
